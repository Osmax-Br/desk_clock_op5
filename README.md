a nice oled clock that displays weather data and other things

I used a new technique to view an icon that changes according to weather eg when it is rainy
it shows a drop and so on .... I spent so much time designing them pixel by pixelðŸ˜…

it also shows other weather data such as pressure , temperature , humidity etc..

data is taken from the internet via open weather map , unfortunately their data is unreliable

but in all cases , you can replace the data from any source and use the same code for displaying the data

time and date are from NTP

it was my very first project using esp8266 and connecting it to the internet ,
 so please dont mind the Unclean-Unefficient code combination

but it is very cool try in my opinion :)
